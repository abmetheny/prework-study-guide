        <h2>HTML</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">

        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>Three ways to style a webpage:
            <ul>
              <li>Inline CSS: Applies style to a specific tag directly in the HTML file.</li>
              <li>Internal Style Sheet: Embeds stylesheet in HTML file using a &lt;style&gt; element in the &lt;head&gt; element. Rules only apply to that page.</li>
              <li>External Style Sheet (most common): CSS rules are kept in a separate file, using a &lt;link&gt; element in &lt;head&gt;.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>CSS Rules contain Selectors (the element/attributes to which the rule applies) and Declarations (the CSS property to apply and the value of the property)</li>
          <li>Using * as Selector applies the rule to all visible elements on a page.</li>
          <li>Margin is the space around the outside of an element; Padding is the space around the content inside an element.</li>

        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">

        <h2>Git</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>git status: checks what branch you are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b [branch-name]: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add -A: stages files (always stage after saving changes)</li>
          <li>git commit -m "[commit message]": leave a detailed message about what changedn</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: pulls main source code to ensure feature branch is up to date with main before merging</li>
          <li>git push origin [name of your feature branch]: merges feature branch changes into main</li>

        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>JavaScript is case sensitive. </li>
          <li>Whereas CSS styles are linked within the &lt;head&gt; element,the JS file is linked within the &lt;body&gt; element.</li>
          <li>Variables: Containers that store values
            <ul>
              <li>Declare a variable: let [myVariable];</li>
              <li>Give the variable a value: let [myVariable] = "[value]"</li>
              <li>Retrieve the value: [myVariable];</li>
              <li>Change the value later in the code: [myVariable] = "[newValue]"</li>
              <li> Data types: String, Number, Boolean (true/false), Array (multiple values), Object (anything else)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Method: A set of instructions that can be executed by a computer.</li>
          <li>Add a comment: // [comment] or /* [comments spanning multiple lines] */</li>
          <li>Operator: Mathematical symbol based on two values/variables (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide; Assignment; Strict Equality; Not, Does-Not-Equal).</li>
          <li>Conditionals: Tests if an expression returns true or not (e.g., if...else, while).</li>
          <li>Functions: A set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task; must be called by name in order to execute. Looks like a variable name followed by (), then add {} that contain the code for the task we want to perform.</li>
          <li>Events: Code structures that listen for activity in the browser and run code in response.</li>
          <li>Null: Referse to the absence of a value.</li>
          <li>Objects are the only mutable values in JavaScript. The two types of object properties, data (value, writable, enumeable, configurable) and accessor (get, set, enumberable, configurable), each have corresponding attributes.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is weakly typed; you can often use a value of one type where another is expected and it will be converted to the right type for you.</li>
          <li>Control Flow: The order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, from the first statement at the top of the page down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.</li>
          <li>Falsy values include 0, -0, On, "", null, undevined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with a false value. All other valudes (including Booleans with a true value) are considered truthy.</li>
          <li>For including multiple conditions, use if...else if.</li>
          <li>Arrays store groups of variables and are not limited to a single type of data. Each item is assigned a unique number (i.e., index) that can be used to access individual data inside the array, usually starting with 0 and increasing by one whole number each time.</li>
          <li>Strings must be contained within quotation marks.</li>
          <li>A for loop performs a task on all items in an array and contains three important statements:
            <ul>
              <li>Starting Point (var x = 0)</li>
              <li>Condition (x &lt; shapes.length;)</li>
              <li>Iterative Pattern (x++, which is a shortcut for x+1)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
